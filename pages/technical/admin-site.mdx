# Admin Site

After the release 0.24.14, the admin site has switched to the app folder in Next. With it comes a layout, a template, shared context and a new design style using [flowbite](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/). _**All components in the admin site should be created using flowbite components.**_

## Layout
Ours is used to set the metadata for our pages.

_Layouts provide stability and maintain state across navigation, ideal for consistent site-wide components._

## Template
This is where we add the shared context and the navigation/footer components.

_Templates reset state and re-render with each page visit, suited for specific page behavior_

## Context

```javascript
{
  brands: [], // it grabs the brands so they are always there
  setBrands: () => {},
  toast: {
    open: false,
    content: "",
  },
  setToast: () => {},
}
```

## Usage

<Steps>
### Create a new page
  Create the `page.tsx` file inside the `/app/admin` directory
  - Add any components specific to the page to the same directory
  - Add any components that are shared with other admin pages to `/app/admin/ui`  
### Add page to navigation
  - Open the `pages.tsx` file inside the `/app/admin/lib` directory
  - Add the new page object to the `pages` array of the applicable group<br/>
    _Currently we use a solid icon from the [react-icons library](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) for each page_
</Steps>

### UI

#### Header
  This component is used to display the header of a page. It contains a search bar, filter dropdown, and action button (_optional_).

  props:
  - isLoading/setIsLoading: Needs a loading state for the page and is used to show the skeletons when grabbing the data objects for the page
  - itemSetter: This is the function used to set the data objects for the page. _e.g. if the page is for brands, the itemSetter would be setBrands_
  - itemFetcher: This is the function used to fetch the data objects from the database. It is usually located in the actions file for the page.
  - categories: This is an array of objects used to filter the data objects. Each object consists of a name and options. The name is listed at the top of the filter section and the options are expected in a `{ value, label }` format.

  When utilizing the search and filter capabilities you will need to add the following to the action method that fetches the data objects:
  ```javascript
  let searchParam: string | undefined;
  let filters: string[] = [];

  // example for brands
  // you will need an if statement for each section of your filter
  if (brandId) {
    filters.push(...[brandId].map((id) => `brandId:${id}`));
  }

  if (anotherSection) {
    filters.push(...[anotherSection].map((id) => `anotherSection:${id}`));
  }

  if (search) {
    searchParam = search;
  }

  let prismaFilter = {};

  if (Object.keys(filters).length > 0) {
    prismaFilter = buildFilters(filters);
  }

  if (searchParam) {
    prismaFilter = {
      ...prismaFilter,
      // this is where you will add a section for every column you want to search on
      OR: [
        {
          name: { contains: searchParam, mode: "insensitive" },
        },
        {
          description: { contains: searchParam, mode: "insensitive" },
        },
        {
          whateverelse: { contains: searchParam, mode: "insensitive" },
        },
      ],
    };
  }

  const dataObject = await prisma.dataObject.findMany({
    where: prismaFilter,
    orderBy: {
      createdAt: "desc",
    },
  });
  ```

  #### Form/FormInput
  The `Form` componenet is a styling wrapper for the `FormInput` component. Simply add it like the example below.

  ```javascript
  <Form
    handleSubmit={handleSubmit}
    submitMethod={createResource}
    submitText="Submit Text"
  >
  ```

  Inside the component you are using the `Form` component in pull all of the `react-hook-form` methods from the `useForm` hook and pass them to each `FormInput` component. Below are a few examples of how to use the `FormInput` component.

  ```javascript
  <FormInput
    errors={errors}
    name="brand"
    register={register}
    type="select"
    options={brands.map((brand) => ({
      value: brand.id,
      label: brand.name,
    }))}
    validation={{ required: "Brand is required" }}
  />

  <FormInput
    errors={errors}
    name="name"
    register={register}
    validation={{ required: "Name is required" }}
  />

  <FormInput name="description" type="textarea" register={register} />
  ```
