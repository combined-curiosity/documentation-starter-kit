| 1/25/24  | Jess   | [Polls V1 ✨](https://www.loom.com/share/39377d7426804ef7ad90a4f97ee38028)                           | In this Loom, I'm showcasing version one of the new poll's feature. I'll walk you through the marketing tab in the admin site and demonstrate some easy test data. You'll see an example poll in draft state and another one published on a webinar. I'll show you how the poll works, including the option to view and play through it as a preview. Keep in mind that once a poll is published, you can't edit it anymore. I'll also mention duplicating polls and the publishing requirements.                                                             |

| 9/12/23  | Jess   | [XMS 0.21.4 ✨ New Admin Shipping Page](https://www.loom.com/share/3bba4948e91847f7934496f8d4adea44) | In this video, I introduce the new admin shipping page and explain how it automates the process of creating shipments and printing labels. With this release, the support team no longer needs to manually create shipments and download labels individually. The shipments are now automatically selected on the shipping page and grouped by parcel, making it easier to print labels for multiple shipments at once. I also demonstrate how to reprint labels if needed. Watch the video to learn more about the new admin shipping page and its features. |
