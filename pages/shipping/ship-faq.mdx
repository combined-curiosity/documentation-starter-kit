# Shipping FAQ & Troubleshooting

### Slack Alerts

Automatic alerts will be sent to our [#cc-shippo-shipping](https://combinedcuriosity.slack.com/archives/C033NHZEY1L) slack channel when a shipment fails automatic creation and when an address fails validation. The alerts will give details of the user and their order and what action needs to be taken.

### Address validation

The most common issue is an unvalidated address. Support will reach out to the customer and check their details, then the shipment will need to be created manually. The address can be updated within our manual shipment creation tool on the [admin shipping page](https://prd-xms-api.combinedcuriosity.io/admin/shipping/) after user and order selection with the change address button.
In the case that the address is correct and has falsely failed validation, when you create the shipment manually, do not click the change address button, after entering the other information and clicking next click the override validation button. If this still gives an error, reach out to devs in [#cc-shippo-shipping](https://combinedcuriosity.slack.com/archives/C033NHZEY1L).

### Failed label creation

When N/A is shown in the printed column of a shipment row, that means that an error has occurred in the shipment creation process and caused the label generation to fail. The logic of that table column is if no label url and within five minutes since creation, display reload, or display n/a if over five minutes. This is because we can't make that page reload automatically after label creation ([dev reasons](https://combinedcuriosity.slack.com/archives/C033NHZEY1L/p1708115742679349?thread_ts=1708095845.879769&cid=C033NHZEY1L)).
You have the option to retry a shipment that has been marked as N/A. Clicking that button will load the failed shipment's info into the manual tool. [Here](https://combinedcuriosity.slack.com/archives/C033NHZEY1L/p1708702450664099) is an example of the retry process. This walkthrough is slightly out of date. Now, we have the option of clicking the reload icon or N/A will open a modal of the Shippo label creation errors, if any, instead of having to log into Shippo in a new tab.
If that modal doesn't work, check [Shippo](https://apps.goshippo.com/shipments) to see what the error was and report it in the [#cc-shippo-shipping](https://combinedcuriosity.slack.com/archives/C033NHZEY1L) slack channel. The most common error messages and their fixes are described in the [Shippo support docs](https://support.goshippo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002024943-Troubleshooting-Common-Error-Messages-in-Shippo).
Some errors can be fixed by retrying the shipment manually, but others may require a specific rate or carrier to be picked. This is not yet an option in our manual tool, so in this case, it would be necessary to recreate that order and shipment in Shippo directly. Once you have done that, archive the failed shipment in our system so that others will know it has been taken care of.
Archiving can be done to N/A shipments by clicking the retry button and then the "Archive without recreating" button within the manual form, as shown in the example linked above. Don't forget to print out the new label from Shippo, and find the corresponding slack alert in [#cc-shippo-shipping](https://combinedcuriosity.slack.com/archives/C033NHZEY1L) and give it a green check mark.

### Parcel data

Our shipping processes are improving. Package skus and Shippo parcel templates are a known trouble area that will be focused on next.
For now, the package sku must be something the warehouse knows what to pack a shipment with, and it must match the name of a package template inside Shippo in order to set the package dimensions.
Splitting this into separate fields is still in the planning stages (a shortened “sku” field to tell warehouse, and a more generic field that matches the package Shippo is looking for ie “9x2x2 box” or “polymailer”). The project is ticketed [here](https://linear.app/combined-curiosity/issue/ENG-2490/improve-shipping-processes).

### Other shipment creation failure

Sometimes it is just a hiccup in the apis that causes the error. Try to manually create it via our admin tool, and reach out to devs if it gives a new error.
