<Steps>
### Edit connection details on `facebook_ads_setup_raw` to include the new brand.
### Edit connection details on `facebook_insights_raw` to include the new brand.
### Verify Pinterest ads and TikTok ads connections are syncing the new brand to the warehouse.
### Create a new schema in the warehouse called `adwords_<brand abbreviation>`.
### Grant write permissions on that schema to the `fivetran` user.
### Create a new Google Ads connection in fivetran syncing to the new schema for the new brand's Google Ads account.
### Once the initial sync is complete, grant read/write permissions to the respective read/write groups in the warehouse by running the result of this query:

```sql copy
select cc_permissions_standard_read_write('adwords_<brand abbrev>', 'read_write')
union all
select cc_permissions_standard_read_only('adwords_<brand abbrev>', 'read_only');
```
