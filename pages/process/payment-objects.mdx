# Payment Objects

Our current business model involves selling offers. Each offer comprises a single package, and each package contains at least one product. These products serve as both the access points for users within our system and the items we dispatch to them via mail.

- [Offers](/process/payment-objects/offers)
- [Packages](/process/payment-objects/packages)
- [Products](/process/payment-objects/products)

The information from these objects is how we build out the payment modal.
