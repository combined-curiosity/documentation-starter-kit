# Router 2.0

- [Technical Documentation](https://github.com/combined-curiosity/router-lambda-cloudfront/blob/main/README.md)

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for creating entities for the new Router 2.0. The purpose of this documentation is to guide you through the creation and optimization of routing strategies for our diverse web requests.

At the core of this system lies the Configuration (`RouterConfig`), serving as the overarching blueprint that orchestrates the routing logic. Each Configuration is composed of Cases (`RouterCaseTargets`), rule-based conditions (`CaseRules`) that dictate how incoming Request Signals are to be handled. Cases (`CaseConfig`), in turn, are constructed from Rules (`RuleConfig`), which pinpoint specific attributes within the Request Signal for evaluation. The smallest unit, the Rule, encapsulates individual conditions utilizing our proprietary Combined Curiosity Case Query Language (C3QL), offering a rich set of comparisons for dynamic routing decisions. Additionally, each Case is associated with a Target (`TargetConfig`), defining the destination or action to be taken when the rules are satisfied.

We appreciate your dedication to optimizing web traffic routing, and to aid you in this endeavor, we've included step-by-step guides for working with Configurations, Cases, Rules, and Targets. Let's embark on a journey to unlock the full potential of our router configuration system.

## What do we use router for?
Router directs traffic from a router path to specific targets (landing pages). This is particularly useful for splitting traffic in an experiment, or personalization (coming soon) based on what we know about the user and/or traffic source. We can also use these in cases where we do not want to (or cannot) update the user-facing url, but can swap out the landing page experience (i.e. in ads, emails, etc). As such, most (all) user-facing links should be router links.

To get started, you can review the following Looms that explain the basic principles of Router.

## Definitions
| Term   | Definition                       | Example |
| :----- | :------------------------------- | :------ |
| Router path | The user-facing url, where user traffic hits. | play.pianoinaflash.com/webinar-registration/ |
| Target path | The target url, where the landing page content is hosted. | lp.pianoinaflash.com/blah-blah-blah |
| Buckets     | User is assigned a random bucket value, 0-11. This determines what target they are served. | - |
| Rules       | Rules are the conditions defined about the user traffic. | Specific router path, specific bucket values, or url parameters (future) |
| Cases       | Cases are the collection of rules. Path and buckets must be defined | Combination of router path and specific bucket values |
| Configuration | Where cases are tied to targets. Given any case, what target should router serve the user? Config is specific to domain and includes all case/target pairs for that domain | - |

## Rules

Rules **can** be reused across multiple cases.

### Create a rule

<Steps>
  ### Navigate to the [Router 2.0](https://prd-xms-api.combinedcuriosity.com/admin/router/) page.
  ### Click on the `Rules` tab.
  ### Click on the plus icon next to the section title.
  ### Complete all necessary fields.
  ### Click `Create`.
  ### Look for the success message confirming the rule was created.
  ### The section will automatically refresh, and the new rule will appear in the list.
</Steps>

## Cases

Cases **can** be reused across multiple configurations. Cases *should*, at a minimum, contain one rule concerning the split of buckets and one rule concerning the path.

### Create a case

<Steps>
  ### Navigate to the [Router 2.0](https://prd-xms-api.combinedcuriosity.com/admin/router/) page.
  ### Click on the `Cases` tab.
  ### Click on the plus icon next to the section title.
  ### Complete all necessary fields.
  ### Click `Create`.
  ### Look for the success message confirming the case was created.
  ### The section will automatically refresh, and the new case will appear in the list.
</Steps>

## Targets

Targets **can** be reused across configurations within the **same** parent domain.

### Create a target

<Steps>
  ### Navigate to the [Router 2.0](https://prd-xms-api.combinedcuriosity.com/admin/router/) page.
  ### Click on the `Targets` tab.
  ### Click on the plus icon next to the section title.
  ### Complete all necessary fields.
  ### Click `Create`.
  ### Look for the success message confirming the target was created.
  ### The section will automatically refresh, and the new target will appear in the list.
</Steps>

## Configurations

Configurations are **unique** to each domain. They can also only be activated once. When a new configuration on the same domain is activated the previous configuration is deactivated. *Once a configuration has been activated it can no longer be edited.*

### Create a configuration

<Steps>
  ### Navigate to the [Router 2.0](https://prd-xms-api.combinedcuriosity.com/admin/router/) page.
  ### Click on the `Configurations` tab.
  ### Click on the plus icon next to the section title.
  ### Complete all necessary fields.
  The `Entries` portion of the form has to include at least one pairing of `Case` and `Target` in order to be submitted. When you add a new entry it will be blank allowing you to select the order, `CaseConfig`, whether its a route or a redirect, and the `TargetConfig`. When clicking the add case or target button a modal will appear allowing you to search through existing cases and targets. Once you select the desired case or target *and* clicked the `Done` button it will be added to the entry. However until you click the `Save` check icon to the right nothing is actually recorded.
  ### Click `Create`.
  ### Look for the success message confirming the configuration was created.
  ### The section will automatically refresh, and the new configuration will appear in the list.
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="❗️">
  For each router path, all bucket values must be covered to proceed. Be careful to not accidentally overdefine bucket values, as the order of the configs will take precedent. For example, a case defining 100% of traffic that comes before a case defining 50% of the traffic will supercede the latter.
</Callout>

### Copy an existing configuration

<Steps>
  ### Navigate to the [Router 2.0](https://prd-xms-api.combinedcuriosity.com/admin/router/) page.
  ### Click on the `Configurations` tab.
  ### Click on the copy button on the configuration you want to copy.
  ### Look for the success message confirming the configuration was copied.
  ### The section will automatically refresh, and the new configuration will appear in the list.
</Steps>

### Edit an existing configuration

<Steps>
  ### Navigate to the [Router 2.0](https://prd-xms-api.combinedcuriosity.com/admin/router/) page.
  ### Click on the `Configurations` tab.
  ### Click on the edit button on the configuration you want to edit.
  ### Make the necessary changes.
  ### Click `Save`.
  ### Look for the success message confirming the configuration was edited.
  ### The section will automatically refresh, and the new configuration will appear in the list.
</Steps>

### Activate a configuration
[Loom reference](https://www.loom.com/share/b1cc858795174132b66023fa2ae11852)

<Steps>
  ### Navigate to the [Router 2.0](https://prd-xms-api.combinedcuriosity.com/admin/router/) page.
  ### Click on the `Configurations` tab.
  ### Click on the activate button on the configuration you want to activate.
  A confirmation modal will appear that breaks up the differences by path between the current configuration and the one you want to activate. Once you click through each of the pages you will see a `Activate` button. 
  ### Click `Activate`.
  ### Look for the success message confirming the configuration was activated.
  ### The section will automatically refresh, and the configuration will have updated to display that it has been activated.
</Steps>

### Checking a configuration

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  This check makes sure that both the config is set up correctly and that there are no issues on the target landing pages.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  ### After activating a configuration, it may take 10-15 minutes to update.
  ### Go to a new or updated router path that you want to check.
  ### If the path is on a split and you want to check all targets, reset your cookie in Chrome by going to the Dev Tools -> Application -> Cookies -> subdomain and searching for abtesting-unique-id
  ### Double click and delete to clear this cookie. Your split will be re-assigned after reloading.
  ### You may have to repeat the above steps a few times to view all variations.
</Steps>
